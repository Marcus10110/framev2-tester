# Frame V2 Tester

This is a quick Python high level analyzer used for quickly viewing the output format of the built-in C++ analyzers like Serial, I2C, etc.

It summarizes the data members and frame type for every input frame, and displays it on the graph as well as prints it to the terminal.

It's intended to be used as an internal tool to quickly test the outputs of C++ analyzers cross-platform, but if it helps you in any way, please use it!
